    - when rsync is used to copy files to an ntfs filesystem, is there a switch to stop permissions being transfered so that there are not errors reported by rsync ?


    - When using rsync to copy files to an NTFS filesystem, you can use the --no-perms option to prevent the transfer of permissions. This option tells rsync not to set the permissions of the destination files to be the same as the source files.

    - Here's an example command:

    - ```bash
        rsync -a --no-perms source_directory/ /mnt/ntfs_mount_point/
    ```

    - In this example, the -a option is used to preserve various attributes of the files, such as timestamps and ownership, but --no-perms is added to exclude the permissions. Adjust the paths according to your source and destination directories.

    - Keep in mind that NTFS does support a form of permissions, but they are different from the Unix-style permissions that rsync typically deals with. If you're copying files to an NTFS filesystem and don't want to encounter permission-related errors, using --no-perms can be a sensible choice.

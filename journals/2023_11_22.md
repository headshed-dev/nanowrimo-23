- if companies don't like WFH, who is it that enforced a return to office, is it the workers themselves or their managers ? Likely it is the latter, not the former. Who predominantly does the work that is required to make the things that do the things that make the company work, likely, the former, not the latter. So whichever way you cut it, its all about control or a sense of control. What is making it all worse are workers that work out they don't need to do much work at all and WFH can make that even more easy to (un)achieve leaving those that live by the work ethic to pick up the slack. I've not found many jobs in my time I could do more than one of them as the one is already enough. Devops and SRE is already demanding enough, if a job doesn't utilise me enough, I would need to question myself as to why that is and potentially move on to something that does.

- for tomorrow, berkleydb - DNS and key stores, used now by object DBs and a thing called Deno, mongo and lots more like it
	- stupid fast
	- suited to things that match a use case, eg post code, remember that story ? certain power company using post codes for remediation, year or so later they end up on watchdog for sending bailiffs to propoerties of which were not even customers. But they we able to use postcodes efficienttly were'nt they ? I wonder how they did that. I have an idea. give someene a hign poweredd car, they can still drive it into a wall
	- another key value db, cockroachdb - check it out TODO with a layer of query engine atop with Postgresql interface, but under the hood, a key value db non the less
	- hash dbs, fundamental of computer science.
	- other db related for monitoring, sql we used 3.x TODO and now at TODO, now mariadb - how did it get there ? but was how we stored producxtion data and time series data
	- other dbs that are used for such and not intended for that, Elastic TODO, and a silly conversation I had with a russian developer saying I was wrong saying you need to use time series for time based data and Elastic ( ELK ) is the way. interesting tech blindness and in the face of failed use of nerd life
	- another TODO, wasnt there an extention to another time series DB, was it promethius? or similar, to  manage data that is document based, like Elastice, that is then

- plan for a story about the smart arse
	- conversation in a kitchen with a programmer that works for the wealthy business owner
	- talking about new frameworks for front end user interfaces and back end languages
	- the programmer is quite well educated sounding and has been speding tiem talking to an ops person that is not that technical and doesnt write code and are not therefor a threat
	- this new person in the kitchen is expressing his opinions on the new UI technogies he is interested in and has experimented with, all be it, in his own time, not company time
	- unusually to him, the programmer is quite aloof, not wanting to talk much to him soon to dissapear and in the weeks and months ahead, this new persons job turns into a nighmare
	- the wealthy business owner turn against him, subjecting him to long hours with no recompense beyond what they think of as a geneous base rate, which isnt, its around a 3rd of what they should be paying but the whole sector has been salary fixing for over 10 years
	- the wealthy business owners have no need to invest in newer technologies and do not take kindly to people close to their operational staff that can bring these newer things in, rather they want to containerise crap old solutions written in languages from the 1990s as these have been paid for, using later technologies would require re-writes, re-factor and why should they ? These things have been done and paid for and all we need to do is add on to what is already there. After all that is how manufacturing plant works. You build a big factory, it costs a lot of money but you then fill it with cheap workers from all over the world that you can keep on low pay and working conditions and you can maximise your return on investments
	- get this clever person out, as they are starting to challenge the status quo
	- they have 'too much knowlege' so when he started to ask about testing, we told him everything is 100% tested. Its tested on a laptop, in an office somewhere, 1000s of miles away. Its 100% automated, on a laptop somewhere, 1000s of miles away in someones personal imporium of Apple laptops, servers, studios, monitors and big I am office furntiture.

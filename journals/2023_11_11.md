	- plan for a story about the smart arse
	- conversation in a kitchen with a programmer that works for the wealthy business owner
	- talking about new frameworks for front end user interfaces and back end languages
	- the programmer is quite well educated sounding and has been speding tiem talking to an ops person that is not that technical and doesnt write code and are not therefor a threat
	- this new person in the kitchen is expressing his opinions on the new UI technogies he is interested in and has experimented with, all be it, in his own time, not company time
	- unusually to him, the programmer is quite aloof, not wanting to talk much to him soon to dissapear and in the weeks and months ahead, this new persons job turns into a nighmare
	- the wealthy business owner turn against him, subjecting him to long hours with no recompense beyond what they think of as a geneous base rate, which isnt, its around a 3rd of what they should be paying but the whole sector has been salary fixing for over 10 years
	- the wealthy business owners have no need to invest in newer technologies and do not take kindly to people close to their operational staff that can bring these newer things in, rather they want to containerise crap old solutions written in languages from the 1990s as these have been paid for, using later technologies would require re-writes, re-factor and why should they ? These things have been done and paid for and all we need to do is add on to what is already there. After all that is how manufacturing plant works. You build a big factory, it costs a lot of money but you then fill it with cheap workers from all over the world that you can keep on low pay and working conditions and you can maximise your return on investments
	- get this clever person out, as they are starting to challenge the status quo
	- they have 'too much knowlege' so when he started to ask about testing, we told him everything is 100% tested. Its tested on a laptop, in an office somewhere, 1000s of miles away. Its 100% automated, on a laptop somewhere, 1000s of miles away in someones personal imporium of Apple laptops, servers, studios, monitors and big I am office furntiture.
	- The sofware build is so eye wateringly complicated that only this one person actually has an incling of how to build it, but even he doesnt really know how, as the software build he has is on one of these laptops right now and its never been built from scratch for months, if not years, each time a new version comes along he's just updated his libraries, compilers, operating system as he's gone along, so how he arrived at the current working version is more by accident than by design, all the time justifying in his own mind that he knows what he is doing and that his Makefiles are 2nd to none as that's how he learnt to build software years ago and it worked then, why should it not work now ? Why would you ever need to build in a 'clean' build environment that is torn down, built up on demand, why would you ever want to do this, when you've got his office right there with all the kit in it he likes to take pictures of and put on the internet ?
	- lets have a debate on this, should we do unit testing ? We need to have a healthy debate on this key point. We dont at all understand what this thing the new guy has started asking about, this 'unit testing' but we dont want as business owners and managers to admit to the fact that we dont at all know what this really means or what ramifications it has for having it or not, let alone why we should ever use it in the first place, so lets treat it as 'healthy debate', like they do in our great democracies.
	- we certainly wouldnt want to distrupt the market place we have now created for testers who test our software. They do it all manually of course but we dont ever bring that to anyones attention, rather, we pass spread sheets around that say what tests have been done and what the test coverage is, in our minds, right now achieved. There is never any direct link, logical or otherwise between the tests we do and the physical code, so no automated test coverage report could ever be done but we report on a test coverage, based upon 'stories' and 'stories' are a part of 'agile'. We dont at all know what 'agile' means but we can make up a bunch of things that we do like 'show and tell', 'stand up',

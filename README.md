# nanowrimo-23

This is a git repository that contains a logseq graph that is a journal of my attempt to complete 30 days of writing for the month of November 2023.

Most of the content is in the form of markdown files that are stored in the [pages](./pages) and [journals](./journals) directories.

These are the entries for Jon's attempt to complete 30 days of writing for the month of November 2023. 

It is participating in [nanowrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/) for the same.

The goal is to write 50,000 words in 30 days.

> "In 2007 I began using a service called 'pinboard' that stores web page bookmarks that perhaps even today few know about or are aware of. Bookmarks were something that people used to use to keep note of web pages that they had found useful or returned to for reference when the internet started, although it was quite different to the web as we know it today in 2023. What was true then is the same now though. How do we make sense of it and what have we found that is of benefit to our future selves ?"

This project is an attempt on my part to log my progress in these goals as a technolgoy worker and to make something that is of use to others that follow.

As these writing are commited to this git repository, they may simply be read using the browser and by looking through

 [journals](./journals) 
 
 or 
 
 [pages](./pages) 
 
 directories or alternatively by downloading the logseq application and opening the repository in that application so as to experience the way in which the content has been authored.

## Technology

If using Logseq, having downloaded this repository to a local directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/headshed-dev/nanowrimo-23.git
```

or by downloading the zip file from the github page

https://github.com/headshed-dev/nanowrimo-23/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

then extracting the zip file to a local directory then Logseq may be download at

https://logseq.com/ and look for the 'download for Windows / Mac / Linux' button

Then install logseq and configure it. 

To do this, start Logseq and open up the menu on the left top and click on the top left icon to 'Add new graph', give it the directory that you downloaded the repo to.

This should open this logseq graph so you can search for content using the search icon top left, browse by 'Journals' or view the graph by clicking on 'graph view' in the left menu.

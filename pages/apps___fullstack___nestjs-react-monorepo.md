- this to do with restul apis, nestjs is one of the most respected ( according to my reading so far ) restapi frameworks
	- it is nodejs, typscript and based on expressjs but also can do fastify, yet another

		- as for hosting, I would go for my own vm, docker and local file store or encrypted buckets for current use cases but another interesting approach is to go for a variety of BaaS providers for which [back4app](https://blog.back4app.com/nest-js-hosting-providers/) themselves a BaaS summarize a number of options in this regard, some are even free forever tier, offering zero cost start up and possibly not-for-profit / charity options

	- Twiki was a Perl based wiki created by a guy called Peter Thoeny. I took a look at their web site and blog, both of which sadly look a little outdated by todays standards. The first thing I noticed wat the copyright notice that went up to 2022, but we are in 23 now, so the footer hasnt been updated possibly for a year and lacks javascript that could update this on the fly for them but perhaps there is a reason for this so I wont be picky. Their blog shows an entry from 2021

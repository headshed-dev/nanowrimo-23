	- Twiki was a Perl based wiki created by a guy called Peter Thoeny. I took a look at their web site and blog, both of which sadly look a little outdated by todays standards. The first thing I noticed wat the copyright notice that went up to 2022, but we are in 23 now, so the footer hasnt been updated possibly for a year and lacks javascript that could update this on the fly for them but perhaps there is a reason for this so I wont be picky. Their blog shows an entry from March 2021 so doesnt look like its doing that much right now.
	- Back in the day, Wikimedia was a new thing and we were all looking for a way to make our content real and interesting. As a productivity tool, I started looking for self hosted wiki like services I could use to keep my personal notes and documentation.
	- This quickly evolved into something many people like to call Jira today. A company wide knowlege base where all your documentation can live and be searchable.
	- case study
		- a jira document store holding information going back to the companies start holds documents and howtos by employees long gone and of varying quality
		- some examples would be of how to fix a broken service by running an SQL query. The problem is that the SQL query does not do what the person has documented it to do, more over it has no result that could even resemble what needs to be done, it is just a badly copied quiery from the persons personal knowlege base and that

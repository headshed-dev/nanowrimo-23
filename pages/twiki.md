	- Twiki was a Perl based wiki created by a guy called Peter Thoeny. I took a look at their web site and blog, both of which sadly look a little outdated by todays standards. The first thing I noticed wat the copyright notice that went up to 2022, but we are in 23 now, so the footer hasnt been updated possibly for a year and lacks javascript that could update this on the fly for them but perhaps there is a reason for this so I wont be picky. Their blog shows an entry from March 2021 so doesnt look like its doing that much right now.
	- Back in the day, Wikimedia was a new thing and we were all looking for a way to make our content real and interesting. As a productivity tool, I started looking for self hosted wiki like services I could use to keep my personal notes and documentation.
	- This quickly evolved into something many people like to call Jira today. A company wide knowlege base where all your documentation can live and be searchable.
	- case study
		- a jira document store holding information going back to the companies start holds documents and howtos by employees long gone and of varying quality
		- some examples would be of how to fix a broken service by running an SQL query. The problem is that the SQL query does not do what the person has documented it to do, more over it has no result that could even resemble what needs to be done, it is just a badly copied quiery from the persons personal knowlege base and that has never been peer reviewed, however this person, as the 'last man standing' is regarded as an expert in this area. Aditional to this confusion is the fact that there is no one else in the company that has anything to do with this area of the business and so no one can verify the information.
		- the jira document store is hosted internally, as this was done before the cloud was a popular choice and the license paid to download the software has not been renewed in order to get updates, however the software is still being used. Hardware has been allocated some time ago in a limited in house virtualisation environment which has now been lifted to run in a VM in the cloud but this also is being kept to a minium in order to keep costs down. The search index is not running, so documents that have been uploaded in the past are not available in search results however existing employees, being wize to this, have bookmarked all the parts that they need access to. They do not pass these precious pieces of information to new starters. So when a person that is started recenently in the company goes on call, at 3am a system fails, they cannot find any information on this system, all be it one that has not been looked at for months, even since before they started and they have no idea what to do. The next day the person is questioned as to why they were not able to fix the fault and suddenly, the search result for that problem magically sorts itself out, now becoming available for all to see. 
		- these exccuses for documentation and people squirreling away information for their own benefit is not uncommon 
		- knowledge is power and people will use it to their advantage
		- knowledge bases there for need to be peer reviewed and kept up to date and it cannot be left to the individual to do this, it needs to be a company wide effort
		- limiting resources to keep costs down is a false economy and hurts not only those trying to do their job but also the company as a whole and ultimately the customer and the reputation of the company
		- 
	- often people hold on to information as a way of keeping their job or holing on to power.
	- sharing knowledge is a good thing and should be encouraged but it cannot in environments where negative thinking as a result of poor management is allowed to fester

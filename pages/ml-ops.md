	- on YouTube I came across a guy called [pau](https://substack.com/@paulabartabajo) presenting a course on Machine Learning Operations with a another guy [Paul](https://substack.com/@pauliusztin) 
		- Pau mainly delivers with Paul from time to time punched in to clarify some points. He is using substack as his place to record links to stuff, not found any reference to Discord yet, mebe that's for paying subscribers on substack. It could be worth the investment, but I'm not sure yet.
		- It is interesting how a lot of creators are going outside of YouTube to gain funding, this being one of several. Patrreon was one of the first, buy me a coffee also has been around for quite some time. Youtube memberships are also on the increase and over in X land, Elon is trying to get away from a failing advertising model by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee. 
		- The algorythm changed on YouTube a years or so ago now and what would have been profitable smaller channels fell off the scope and only 'influancas' with over a million subs got promoted. Adverts got pushed 2 or 3 times in short videos with no option to skip after a few seconds on some. Pre ads might run now for minutes at a time now forcing me sometimes to quit the video and go elsewhere.
		- As a learning tool, YouTube has been the defacto place to further knowlege and share new ideas and I have found it a bounteous source of knowlege for IT and computer science. 
		- Before this, I used Udemy, which as I see it democtratized e-learning. I was accustomed to waiting for companies to not pay for training and to have to buy it myself but at one time it was something you could get sponsored for where you worked. I spent just over a month on Solaris training at various campuses in the south of the UK, in London on London Bridge as I remmber it and all were hotel accomodation and long stay overs. It was submersive and speacialised, high cost and very focussed. Nothing is the same now, although I am certain courses like this still exist. I've hear of 'apple training school' of which I am sure is a similar thing and only for the privilaged few or deep pocketed individuals.
		- The internet has been a place I have gone to after the before times and when it started and we used noisy modems to connect to the world wide wait to slowly download long pages and clunky images to find information, to learn and research, for on line documentation and code.

	- I worked with PGP and used SSL / TLS from the beginning, even being criticized by old school thinkers for not using plain text network communication
	- I remember feeling confused and a little fearful of PGP and using encryption in general. Granted this was a while ago now and I certainly dont have that now. If you find the idea of using high grade encryption daunting, perhaps a contributing factor to this could be the hype / mystique surrounding it. I think this is a shame and I hope to help dispel this myth. It is true that encryption itself is a highly complex subject, but using it is not. I hope to show you that using encryption is not as hard as you might think.
	- there are broadly two main types of encrytion, symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption is where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. Asymmetric encryption is where two keys are used, one to encrypt and one to decrypt. The key used to encrypt the data cannot be used to decrypt it and vice versa. Asymmetric encryption is also known as public key encryption.
	- so lets break this down. The first of the two approaches, the one they call symmetric, means that you have some text or picutre data, movie file, whatever. The data that your computer stores is represented by numbers in a file on your disk. To encrypt the data, that is, make it undecyperhable by someone you dont want reading it needs to be mathmatecally strambled, like scrambling an egg but with a difference. This omlette, you can reverse back into being just the eggs you stared out with, each back in their shells and perfectly what you had to start off with. The reversability of this omlette making / reversal is the majic that we dont need to understanc intimately, rather we can see this as a tool that does this for us.

	- 101 learning to program I was taught that error messages in our code are important. That they should be firstly there. Non programmers likely do not fully appreciate that it is possible, in some languages more than others but in most to write code that can go down a wrong path and fail with a variety of unexpected, to that of the user, entirely unexpected outcomes.
	- To the run time, the outcome of a memory dump, a stack trace scrolling off the end of the screen, a flashing cursor in the screen where you would expected a screen of well formatted screen estate, now surrounded by flashing numbers, characters from outer spacd and colours of the rainbow. 
	- Other times, the famouse 'blue screen of death', that of the windows operating system, or the 'kernel panic' of the linux operating system. The blue screen of death ofcourse is more common, due to the sheer numbers of Windows and NT based systems at that time.
	- I new one I became aware of, quite painfully for me at the time was 'the white screen of death' programming Wordpress. I'm not certain why I never came across such untill I did, as up to then I had been programming CGI scripts without frameworks that were supposed to help you along in the process and had learnt to swim in the copious errors that these environments would yield in logs, on the consele and in the browser itself.
	- Chrome browser tools were not a thing then, so you couldnt examine the browser console for errors, you had to rely on the server logs and the browser itself.
	- I think all I had done was to edit a function in a theme. The entire web site returned immediately, no spinny wheel in the browser, no error message in the page, just a white screen. 
	- You can get a bit panicky at this point and start to think you can't fix this, you perhaps shouldnt be doing this at all in fact, perhaps you chose the wrong career path, and the mind can go further down a path of deep despair and anxiety.
	- Compiliing the kernel, in Linux was not just something people did for kicks back in the day, before Y2K. It was often born out of sheer necessity. If you had a SCSI card ( Small Computer System Interface ) and a SCSI hard drive, you would need to compile the kernel to include the driver for the SCSI card, and the file system driver for the SCSI hard drive, if it were not already supported in the kernel. I remember something called something like an Adaptec 5400 or similar being the card I needed to get working and I'd never compiled a kernel in my life before. Code that I had written or downloaded from the internet, yes, but not a kernel.
	- Back then, linux operating systems did not have yet any mature package management so in the case of slackware, you downloaded archive files in the tar format ( tape archive ) and extracted them into the root directory of somewhere under /src or /usr/src. It had to be in the write place amidst the other source code files, or the kernel would not compile.
	- There were make files, which are like a recipe for compiling the code, and you would run a make command to compile code but the linux distribution came with a 'cursors' text based menu system that would guide you through the process of compiling the kernel but this was primitive and you had to know what you were doing. Things improved over time ofcourse and whilst the same or similar exists on many Linux distributions today, it is much more user, or should I say, developer friendly.
	- Error messages from the compiler were at best useless to most novices.
	- My 'favourite' so to speak was `Error: 1` amidst a sea of random gibberish. It was at this point I realised that pretty much no effort had been put into error handling in the code from which this had come from. I was not alone, I was not an ignorant, unworth savage that should not have been there and had not earnt the right to be doing anytyhing technical.
	- When the company called RedHat came about, they made a lot of changes to the way Linux was built, introducing 'RPM' ( RedHat Package Manager ) and a lot of other things that made it easier to install and manage software on Linux. They also made a lot of changes to the kernel, and the way it was compiled. One thing they did in their infinite wisdom was to swap out the gcc compiler at one poing and subsequently, unless you knew what you were doing, you would get a lot of errors when trying to compile the kernel. Most folks that started looking into Linux at this point were often put off when they then needed to compile a kernel to get something working and it would not compile, my favrouite error message being `Error: 1` might even pop up at this point.
	- Search engines and Stack Overflow did not exist yet, so searching many different sources, on line forums, email lists and so forth was the only way to get help.
	- The 'problem' went away when the gcc compiler was swapped back in, but it was a good example of how arbritary changes can have a huge impact on the user experience, even going as far as putting some people off using something entirely.

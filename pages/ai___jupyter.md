	- I got quite confused looking at [autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) thinking it was all written in jupyter notebooks which in point of fact it clearly isnt, rather its all in `.py` ( python ) where as the notebook files, of which there are many under the directory name of the same, for example `agentchat_function_call.ipynb` all ending in `.ipynb` which coerce the github algorythm into classifying the project as jupyter notebook. It isnt but this is a common effect of the same mis-apprehension and skewed computation that takes place on other projects I work on now, Dart / Flutter being a case in point.
	- Modern frameworks no longer just exist as themelves, written in C, coded in C, stored in C, there is nothing else to see here but C.
	- I became aware back in the early noughtys, when I was learning a lot of new things, that code could generate code. A project I supported back then, written in Perl, remember that ? If you don't, your too young. This project was the precursor to what we know of today as moderne 'e-Commerce' solutions. Well, in order to add dynamic pezazz and doo hickies aplenty, the coders of this project decided to employ generative code into their architecture. What this meant was that they wrote code that would generate code. Subsequently they created a sort of code dialect that could describe their intended outcome. This allowed them flexibility in the way they described and coded solutions in their application. This application would be described as a 'framework' in todays parlance I would suppose.
	- Rather than dissapearing into the mists of time, this kind of thinking and approach to programming has not gone anywhere. It has grown legs and become bigger, even monstrously big to the point that we are at just now where things like 'transpilers' exist, for example in the world of Javascript frameworks, it is common to have a framework that you write in 'modern Javascript' which is too new to be run on a significant percentage of web browsers out there, then for it ( the framework ) to 'transpile' said modern code into something that can be understood by the older, prevalent tech.
	- Cross-compiling, something I dabbled with when building my own Linux distributions for fun and when building firewalls that ran on distributions and architectures different to that of my PC or laptop was quite common for things written in C, C++ but today, the 'compilation target' is become quite the moving target
	- Take Flutter as a case in point just now. Flutter is a framework for writing mobile apps. At least that is how it started out but now it can do just that and much more. You write your code in Dart, a javascript like language with a heavy dose of strict typing, Java like patterns and Google programming philosophy I would say baked in. Then the flutter command line tool 'cross compiles' your dart application into
	- I like this from the [Jupyter web site](https://jupyter.org/) :
		- > JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

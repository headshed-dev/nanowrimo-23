	- I remember thinking way back when the internet was still what we called 'the world wide wait' that security would be something I'd need to spend more time on at a later time. I would be better spending my time learning my craft so to speak. This was born out of a mixture of naievety but above all desperation at what was even then, information overload. This is today symptomised as a part of burn out. Overload is something we've all had to live with, especially in anything technical or technologically based. I heard the term 'internet speed' or the idea that if world history had advanced as much as technology had since the dawn of the internet, the Egyptians would have visited the moon as well as built the pyramids. All nice words.
	- If you today want to get to know how to do things in tech, often people turn to 'home computing' or 'self hosting' as is a thing on the interwebs of the last 10 years and this vastly accelerated by the prevalence of cheaper computing systems, parts and even 'single board computers'. If it were not for Raspberry Pi foundation many today would have never had access to having their own computer to try things out on.
	- Being a part of the tech industry when I did, I didnt need to wait for the price of hardware to fall in order for me to work on some of the latest and greatest, or even just small systems. I was priveleged to work on the latest hardware as it arrived and needed to be installed, built, racked, wired up and have its systems configured, installed, patched, data ingressed, application life cycle managed. 
	- All systems in the beginning needed to be built with the same basic principles. They needed to be built to be secure as the dangers of not doing so were evident even then. The internet was a wild west of sorts and the consequences of not securing your systems would have been catastrophic, as they are today. 
	- As there were no standardised tools for doing all this, as we now have with the likes of Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Salt, etc, we had to build our own. 
	- Securing the operating system was one of the first parts of the process. SELinux was a new thing and was not widely used. It was a pain to configure and was often disabled. Even now I find references to 'disable SE Linux' as part of standard build instructions. But security hardenning was a practice and a set of principles we built into our systems. 
	- There was always a back pressure from management and business units to 'just get it done' and 'we'll fix it later'. This was a constant battle and one I often saw lost. Systems would be built lacking basic security hardenning and would be left that way.
	- Stories would emerge, for example a leading cloud service providor managed to have vast amounts of personal user data exposed on a Mongo database, running on the public internet and having no password set to prevent full access. Some softwares, Mongo was not alone in this, out of the box would have no security enabled and it was left to the engineer to configure it. Under pressure to get things done, this kind of thing could, did and will continue to happen.

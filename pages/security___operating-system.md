- I remember thinking way back when the internet was still what we called 'the world wide wait' that security would be something I'd need to spend more time on at a later time. I would be better spending my time learning my craft so to speak. This was born out of a mixture of naievety but above all desperation at what was even then, information overload. This is today symptomised as a part of burn out. Overload is something we've all had to live with, especially in anything technical or technologically based. I heard the term 'internet speed' or the idea that if world history had advanced as much as technology had since the dawn of the internet, the Egyptians would have visited the moon as well as built the pyramids. All nice words.

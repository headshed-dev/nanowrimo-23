	- this is nothing new as the same can be done with chat-gpt by giving the prompt information so as to instruct the LLM to respond in a given way however this differs significantly in that the llama model has itself been augmented so as to take on this pre-prompt for every session, thus sustaining a configured state between sessions. This is something that chat-gpt in its current form cannot do, rather, state or variable input needs to be managed in pre-promts

	- by the end of July 2007 I was using a perl ide called Padre and assessing another [epic](http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net/) as programming with vim was not delivering in the way I could see other programmers were able to do with their IDEs. 
	- what I found fascinating, as I do today, is a predisposition amongst programmers and hackers to use vim and emacs. Whilst I have never gotten to grips with Emacs, I have always been a heavy user of vi and vim. The modern vim is reborn in the form of [neovim](https://neovim.io/) which I have only dabbled with.
	- I cannot count the hours I have put into configuring vim, vim plugins, sometimes emulating similar in neovim. For a time post to my moving to other languages post to moving away from Perl, continue to use vim as a primary editor for Go and other languages. The integration with Go was, and is still, good. 
	- The primary reason for using an IDE is often code completion. As I type now, in an editor in which copilot is running, even prose is being promted to me. To not have this kind of assistance in any text based work is unusual in 2023. But back in the noughties, it was pretty much you, your editor and your code. 
	- 'prpoper' languages like Java, C#, C++ and so on, all had advanced IDEs I think as long as Windows started to dominate the desktop.
	- As a Unix guy, it was a sort of badge of honour to do everthing in vi. 
	- Web sites often had icons in their footers declaring each of the web standards they were complaint with. It was a thing. Some sported other icons saying what they were built with, such as 'powered by ...' followed by the name and logo of the framework or language. Wordpress templates still do this but I think this shows the datedness of design.
	- 'Built with VIM' with an icon appropriate to the vi editor was used by some and I think I may have even been guilty of this myself.
	- It is true that on Unix operating systems, the 'line editor' as it used to be called, by default was vi. So it was always there. If you were a Unix guy, you used vi and you used it for everything. If you didnt know how to use vi, you couldnt really work in Unix and Linux has carried on this tradition even though many editors could be chosen on Linux even from the mid 90s, pico, elvis, emacs, jed, joe, nano, and so on. I think I see people using Nano a lot now so it seems to have been the one to win out over the others. Yet the editor you choose seems to have been somthing that some saw as something that defined them as a person, which has always puzzled me. I was even asked once at a business meeting by a client, 'Vi or Vim ?'. I took no time to say 'Vim' and I realised that I had been disaproved of for not saying 'Vi'. It was this kind of purism that I believe alienated a lot of people from Unix and Linux and I think it still does, extending far beyond the editor you use.

	- I dont like reading long deffinitions of what a thing is or where it came from and having to read through a bunch of stuff to get to the point. I like to get to the point and then read the details if I need to. Often however I have, and still, find that peoples idea of 'good documentation' needs to read like an academic white paper with 'terms', 'precis', 'definitions' and 'examples' and 'references' and 'further reading' and 'links' and 'footnotes' and 'bibliography' and 'appendix' and 'glossary' and 'index' and 'table of contents' and 'acknowledgements' and 'author' and 'date' and 'version' and 'license' and 'copyright'. Buried, deap within the mighty toam is an example of use that is based, not on a concrete example, but on a hypothetical one that bares little resemblance to anything in the real world.
	- To understand PXE, you need to understand DHCP, TFTP, NFS, and PXE. DHCP is a protocol for assigning IP addresses to devices on a network. TFTP is a protocol for transferring files. NFS is a protocol for sharing files over a network. PXE is a protocol for booting a computer over a network. The PXE protocol is built on top of DHCP and TFTP. But to use PXE, having found appropriate hardware to use it, typically you just need a configuration file.
	- This might suffice

	- What this tells me is that the `dhcp3` daemon is running and configure in `etc`. Its `.conf` file is given a bunch of directives, each of which appear in name / value pairs and on singl lines unless, sensibly grouped with '{' and '}' braces, and that the `subnet` directive is the one that is of interest. The `subnet` directive is given a network address and a netmask. The `range` directive is given a range of IP addresses to assign to devices on the network. The `option routers` directive is given the IP address of the router on the network. The `filename` directive is given the name of the file to use to boot the device. The `next-server` directive is given the IP address of the server to use to boot the device.
	- So there we go, a whole story in a box. What my mind focusses on is `filename="pxelinux.0`. This happy little stanza tells me that the network device will be primed, when it is powered on as a part of the 'hardware boot process' of the system, to start and read this file in order to start up an operating system.
	- This might sound like gobbledeygook, it might not, depending on where you've come from or what you have interests in. To understand how technology works, you have to have an idea of how things work and this typically boils down to how a thing starts, runs and stops. This would in my early days of service management, been a key piece of a run book or support guide.
	- In early 2k, I took it on myself to build a complete operating system by downloading all of its component parts from source where ever I could, compiling each and placing them into scripts capable of orchestrating an OS. This, without completely re-inventing the wheel I achieved, as many before me have done so, using [linux from scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/). There were at the time several modes in which you could do this, where the more 'advanced' levels entailed building the OS from as few pre-built components as you could. Naturally being a sucker for punishment, I chose this path as how else would I find out how a thing really worked ?
	- Prior to this had taken a lot of learning, experience gained working with actual hardware, software, automation learning and a lot of mistakes, manual repetition, frustration, confusion, often wondering what I was doing and why I should even have the right to be there doing this thing. They call that 'imposter syndrome' these days. I call it 'being a human being' if you really are honest about where you are in the greater scheme of things. To over come you just need the right people around you, a tanacity and sense of purpose and a desire to do good.
	- My starting point for real using computers in the 'real world' was working in offices at a local company I worked for as a late teenager that made metal things. I started out as a trainee welder. Welding was something I never got the hang of but part of this training on the 'shop floor' was to operate, drive, sweat over and wrangle with every piece of heavy metal tooling and infrastructure available to a factory making hydraulically enabled tipping boxes to go on the back of heavy trucks. I mostly cut up long bits of metal, box, 'rsj', angle iron, round tuby shaped for axels and hinges using a 'band saw' and getting coverd in 'suds oil' from which I still to this day recall the smell in my nostrels as if it were yesterday. I worked on the 'press and guilly' with 'foxy', the 'press man' and for a time with 'fingers mick', who had lost most of his fingers working on the same machinery. I became good frieds with Foxy and we went to see Pink Floyd at Manchester City Football ground, the first and last time I stood on the pitch at that ground or anywhere near it.
	- After a time, my 'welding training' was brought to a close as I think the employers at that time realised that they were paying me by the hour and I punched a lot of hours. Not only had I done a lot of things on the shop floor with deadly machinery, I had started to work fork lifts, 5 tonne cranes and as I had a driving license, started on fork lifts and shunting lorries in the yard. This was all getting a bit expensive as I was in before 6 and gone after 5 most days and it was going to be cheaper to get me onto a monthy salary and get me off the shop floor, into the office where they could get me to do time cards and other admin. In time, the first 'personal computers' were finding themeslves into the work place and they needed someone to 'look after them'. I was the only one who had any idea what to do, having tinkered with as ZX Spectrum in my early teens, but that is another story.
	- The operating system of the day was then DOS, Windows was not yet a thing. Amstrad was one of the leading technologies of the day, thanks to Lord Sugar of telivisional fame here in the UK. Such a lovely chap, I'm glad to never have worked for him. Data storage was often on 5 1/4 inch floppy drives that really were 'floppy'. I think 10 inches were a thing but I never worked on anything like that and pretty quickly the 'hard case and smaller floppy drives came in that went out of use at a mighty 1.44 megabytes. I dont think I got that capacity on early systems, but memory does not serve me on that detail.
	- We initially started out with PCs that resemled 'IBM clones' of the day and which there were many and that still continues to this day. We worked with a company that came from Kiel University, local to us in the Staffordshire, Stoke on Trent area to implement a coax network that was initially based upon software. For some reason, I think mainly due to it being a bit rubbish, we went over to 'Apricot' PC's which sported then a 'hardware network', whatever that means but I suppose it to be something not dissimilar to what we have today in a network stack that is a part of the operating system. I believe the transition to Apricot from clones was something in part funded by the IT contractores that were used and at least in part driven by the hard bargains driven by my then employers. To say they 'struck a hard bargain' would be an understatement. I am still scared by the memory of dealing with them on a day to day basis, alough I've come across far more, let us say, 'challenging' people since.
	- There were only a handfull of these throughout the offices, one in accounts, one in the office far side from me used by the guy that did 'order process', the managers office next to mine where I ended up working doing a lot of data entry when he went to run his own busines on the other side of town and a main 'server' upstairs with a mighty 20 Megabyte hard drive. This broke one day and I thought we'd lost everything as there were no reliable backups at the time. One of the guys from the IT contract agency came in and he took the drive out of the pc, with the cables still connected and the outer case open. With the power connected, he held the drive in his hand and shook it in a kind of rotational wrist movement and it started to spin. I think the system was then bolted back together with everything still running and at some point a tape drive was added to do backups. I never remember a recovery being done from the tape, so who knows if it worked or not.
	- So that each computer could 'talk' to each other, the server needed to be booted and running and as far as I know, it never got turned off. I pushed tapes into it each day but aside of this, had pretty little to do with it. The network was still based on coaxial cable that formed a 'bus' that had a start and an end. Each 'end' had a 'terminator', a sort of 'cap' that screwed onto the 't' section that plugged into the back of the network card. The network cable was then passed under the floor to go to the next machine in turn and the PCs in between each had a cable in and a cable out, going to the next in the 'daisy chain'. So any breaks or 'disconnects' caused a total failure of the network. Much of my time was spent chasing connection issues untill it was realised that the 'soldered connections' we were using were failing due to Andy from the shop floor giving each cable a good tug when he thought no one was looking. I found a alternative connection piece for to join the cable to the t-piece that used a screw fit, rather than needing a solder joint. This reduced the time it took for me to isolate and fix one of the tugged cables, but it didnt stop Andy and his mates having a go.
	- This was the first instance of a 'security breach' in my IT career I guess but little did I know the horrors that I would see, live and experience in years to come. The same attitude that persisted then, is prevalent today, that of dis-belief that 'it will never happen' and 'the person didn't mean to do it', in other words, a complete lack of responsibility or willingness to confront wrong doers or bad actors until it is far, far too late.
	- In my early days, I guess I mostly thought of a PC starting up or shutting down mostly as a sort of magic trick. I had little idea outside of something called `autoexec.bat`, `msdos.sys` and `io.sys` as to there being any user input into the general operation of the boot process or life cycle. I remember at times 'editting' one or all of these at different times to get things to work when I absolutely had to. One example of this was the mighty 'soundblaster' card. Oh yes, you can get sound to work with PCs, did you know ? Well, I, working at the forefront, the very bleading edge of tech back then did indeed install sound cards into PCs of my own and even other peoples. Yes, other people tried to get me to 'fix their PC', and that happened quite a lot. Today they dont just want me to fix one PC, they expect me to fix an entire infrastructure made up of 1000s of nodes and comprising 100s of different technologies, toolsets, frameworks and other doo hickies. So the same then still applies today, that most folk dont want to or cannot for a variety of reasons, get to grips with making the technology of the day do things for them. The marjority are consigned to be more 'consumers' than 'expert users', let alone architects, developers, operators and so on. Which is a shame really. I think, like math, IT should be an integral part of anyones education, not just a 'specialist' subject for a few.
	- I suppose my experience growing up on a factory shop floor and doing lots of things, each totally different, many with the potentional for loss of limb, severe injury or even sudden death, made me 'the man that I am today'. Ha ha. But seriously folks, what I mean is, doing a 'bit of everything' is often stigmatised as becoming a 'jack of all trades and master of none'. Yet when I went through University and studied under a guy called Alan Eardley at Staffs polytechnic / university as it was when I was to graduate, we got to know about the Japanese industrial culture built around 'just in time'. This abreviates to JIT and was in opposition to the thinking of the day, being 'Manufacturing Resource Planneing', also abreviated to MRP. So the JIT MRP wars raged back in the day of my being covered in suds oil and stinking of sweat and stale cigarette smoke.
	- A core component of the JIT philosophy was the employment of a multi skilled workforce capable of moving from one area of production to the other. This is in stark contrast to the 'division of labour' methodologies of the great Ford motor plants of the day that did the counter opposite of this and led to crazy situations as I see it where humans are reduced to putting wheels onto a car in a production line and all they do, day in, day out is just that. I remember a sketch on a record ( thats a vynil record to you youtube gen Xers, you'll find them in a museum somewhere but I do believe they are having somehign of a come back ) of Peter Sellers, a great British actor, comedian and all round good egg, where he is a factory worker making tooth brushes. He is the one that 'puts the little holes in the tooth brush'. A manager comes to speak with him says he, to say a couple of words, niether of which he understood.
	- I likened in my mind the hybrid working model of JIT to be like, in nature, insect swarms work to achieve a goal. A kind of 'hive mind' enables many, small and seemingly insignificant creatures to achieve great things. We are not insects, so this effect is magnified significantly when we become hybrid in nature. When a 'bottle kneck' happenss in the production line, or any other problem that halts or affects production, the workforce 'flexes' to allocate more or less people to work in one place or another. This is a kind of 'self healing' mechanism that is built into the system. It is not a 'top down' approach where a manager has to be called to 'sort it out'. This is a kind of 'bottom up' approach where the people on the ground, the ones that know what is going on, are empowered to make decisions and take action to resolve issues.
	- Another mind set that is talked about today is 'agile', in which self actuated and responsible teams work together to achieve a goal. This is in contrast to the 'waterfall' approach where a 'project manager' is employed to 'manage' the project. This is a kind of 'top down' approach where the 'manager' is the one that makes the decisions and the 'team' are the ones that do the work. This is a kind of 'command and control' approach that is often seen in the military. It is not a 'bottom up' approach where the people on the ground, the ones that know what is going on, are empowered to make decisions and take action to resolve issues.
	- So there is 'nothing new under the sun' I guess and we have all been trying, an enphasis on trying, to achieve similar things for a very long time. I've no doubt that similar debates went on whilst building the pyramids, and even the Egyptians had slaves that were well qualified, respected and sometime privileged members of society but I would not recommend going back to their way of doing thing however it may make some quite happy for us to do so.
	- Indeed, most of the people I worked with in my early days of 'metal bashing' were each capable of 'having a go' at pretty much everything in the process of manufacturing. The only place that this did not persist was the office. Although I stopped learning to weld when I worked in the office, where I concentrated on daily paper and even time punch card admin, I still did things on the shop floor that did not involve a bic pen or carbon paper copy. When I left this place I was practiced in driving vehicles as I am licensed to up tso 7 tonnes and off road, multi leggers with 8 axels. Thinking back, it was all a bit mad. I was then and still am a hybrid, having a go at lots of things and not focussing upon one or two areas. Indeed I find myself today more of an 'entrepeneur', some may say 'entrepenerd' that co-runs a business and from one day to the next, whilst I primarily, for now, create web and mobile apps, I have to be a programmer, yes, but lots of other things, a copy writer, marketting and sales person, customer liason, accountant, lawyer, business analyst, project manager, product owner, scrum master, devops engineer, cloud architect, security expert, network engineer, systems administrator, database administrator, data scientist, data analyst, data engineer, data architect, data modeler, data visualiser, data miner, data warehouser, data lake builder, AI enginner, AI prompter and the list goes on. I can never be in this short life a master of all but I have to be a master of some. This takes time to become competent in more than one 'pillar' of knowlege but it can and is done. Indeed many people attain to levels of compentence in this way of working but few can stay in one place at a time for very long if they become pidgeon holed into one specific role or functdion.
	- regrettably, many organisations today still harp back to the halcyion days of the ford motor company, when a cooky cutter approach to doing things made so much sense and worked, at the time, for making cars. Lots of cars. They were all the same but you could have them in any colour that you wanted, so long as it was black. This is a kind of 'one size fits all' approach that is still prevalent today.

	- BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) and PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) are both network protocols used for bootstrapping and provisioning network devices, particularly in the context of booting computers or other networked devices over a network. They serve similar purposes, but they are not the same, and PXE is an evolution of BOOTP. Here's an overview of each protocol and how they compare:
	  
	  1. BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol):
		- BOOTP is an older network protocol that was designed to enable diskless workstations to obtain their IP configuration information and boot files from a central server over the network.
		- It uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and operates on port 67 (server) and port 68 (client).
		- BOOTP provides basic IP address assignment, subnet mask, and other configuration details, but it does not include advanced features like dynamic IP allocation and flexible boot options.
		- BOOTP clients are identified by their hardware (MAC) address.
		  
		  2. PXE (Preboot Execution Environment):
		- PXE is an extension of BOOTP and was developed to enhance network boot capabilities, especially for booting PCs and other devices. It builds upon BOOTP but adds additional functionality.
		- PXE allows network devices, such as PCs, to boot over the network and load an operating system image from a remote server.
		- It includes more advanced features, such as the ability to boot from various sources (e.g., local disk, network, CD/DVD, or USB) and enables flexible configuration options.
		- PXE clients are also identified by their MAC address.
		- PXE booting often involves using TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) to transfer boot files and images from a central server to the client machine.
		  
		  In summary, PXE is an evolution of BOOTP and includes additional features and capabilities for network booting. While BOOTP is primarily focused on IP configuration and basic booting, PXE provides more flexibility and functionality, making it the preferred choice for network bootstrapping in modern environments. If you're setting up network booting for PCs or similar devices, PXE is the protocol of choice.

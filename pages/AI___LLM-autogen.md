	- Today I joined a discord group for something called autogen.
	- Autogen is an open source project that is stored on github.
	- I was surprised this morning, watching a Youtube video, that Microsoft is the owner of this repository. Whilst publishded under a creative commons license, it is still a Microsoft project that according to my experience, was not at all common in the past. However, over what has become years of transformational changes, Microsoft have become friendly to open source. There was a horrible level of toxicity in the past, but now, it seems that Microsoft is a different company. The veracity of Microsoft's negative atitude towards Linux, opern source and open standards was so great that even when offered a place to work for Micrsoft a while back I turned down even going to the interview. I wonder occaisonally if I made the right decision but at the least, I dont know how I could have justified this to my partner who had suffered my struggles against Microsoft inspired aggression by others toward me at work in various places. 
	- Right now, I'm not invested in microsoft any more than I use some of their open source products and pay for the use of their office software in the form of 365 on line with all the bells, whistles, bits and bobs that come with it. Teams, dont forget teams, after all, how could we do without teams and who would take us seriously if we couldnt invite people to calls on teams for goodness sake.
	- I have to acknowlege that under their current CEO leadership Satya Nadella who I think is something of a genius to have turned the company around, Microsoft is a different company. I'm not sure if I would work for them, but I would certainly consider it now.
	- When MS bought GitHub, there was a clamour in the open source community to move entire code bases to GitLabs, another rival git repository service on line, so much was the distrust and dislike of Microsoft in the community. 
	- In my view and frakly as I see it now, this was based on mis-conceptions held due to embeded trauma of the past. The only ones really to blame for this reputation would be Microsoft themselves and in particular their previous CEO Steve Ballmer, closely preceded by Bill Gates himself and for the vile things both had said about open source and Linux in particular.
	- As I write this, I am using what is my favoured editor, VSCode, an open source application that is available on Linux, Windows and Mac. I use it on all three platforms and it is is also under Microsoft's stewardship. 
	- I am old enough to remember the days when Microsoft was the enemy of open source and Linux in particular, not to mention the browser wars and the anti-trust case that was brought against them. Even the community of front end developers came out to say how much they disliked Internet Explorer and how much they wanted to see it die. Now it has and we have Edge, which is a Chromium based browser, which is open source and originates from Google, not even Microsoft, yet Microsoft have taken it and made it their own.
	- All of this if you were to speak to me or anyone else who was around at the time, would have been unthinkable. Yet here we are, in a world where Microsoft is a different company and is now a friend of open source, as far as we can tell.

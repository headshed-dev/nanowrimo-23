	- Monitoring is something I could put into a category of its own but I put it under a heading of security because it is a security concern. Indeed as time has gone on, I have found it has been entirely ignored by some as we have adopted cloud based solutions and some have assumed that it is someone else's problem.
	- Monitoring is a key part of any service. It is the way we know that things are working as they should be. It is also the way we know that things are failing.
	- Both are as important. If you are in the unfortunate situation of serving customers with whom there is a bad relaitionship, that is, for whatever reason, trust is lost and whatever goes wrong, you, the supplier are seen as the first place to point the finger, then monitoring is your friend. It is the way you can prove that you are not at fault. Trying to regain trust is very difficult when it has been lost. But if you are to stand a chance of doing this, good monitoring is essential. What this does is to give you statistics that you can use to show that service has been maintained and can be used to diagnose problems, even if they are not your fault.
	- If you dont have this in place, the customer will be assured of being the ones to tell you that there is a problem. This is not a good place to be.
	- If you do have good monitoring in place, you can be the one to tell the customer that there is a problem. This is the better place to be and it will reduce the stress on your team and downtime for your customer as you will be alerted to issues before they escalate.
	- Monitoring is not just about the service itself. It is also about the infrastructure that supports the service. If you are using cloud based services, you will be relying on the cloud provider to provide the infrastructure. But you will still need to monitor the service. If you are using your own infrastructure, you will need to monitor that too.
	- A common mistake I have seen in the modern age of cloud and agile is for services and software to follow best principles in all aspects of software creation, iteration and deployment but to ignore monitoring. The overwelming mindset is from a development point of view and an over enphasis on testing being something that is done by the development team but somehow no longer needed when the software is deployed.
	- I think that this is a symptom of another trend that I have seen in the last 10 years or so. That is, the move away from the idea of a system administrator. This is a role that has been replaced by the DevOps engineer. This is a role that is more focused on the development side of things and less on the operations side. This is a role that is more focused on the software and less on the infrastructure. This is a role that is more focused on the development team and less on the customer.
	- Flippantly I call this 'DevDev' as it is a role that is more focused on the development team and less on the customer and an idea that we no longer need operational thinking.
	- it is not surprising as automation has meant that increasingly, outdated and expensive processes once done by operational staff are now done by software. This is a good thing. But it does not mean that we no longer need operational thinking. Operations popele that did not adapt to this change have been left behind. But the need for operational thinking has not gone away. It has just changed.

	- Having spent a lot of my working life having used service monitoring and at the lack of solutions pre Y2k, developed bespoke solutions that integrated monitoring into many customer solutions and services, this all done by a team of specialist engineers at one of the leading IT service providers at that time, I think I am able to be a reliable witness as to its history and general adoption
	- I remember how I got involved in this was by being approached by a guy called John Connor, who worked in the supprt team for Internet Managed Services at that time. He was interested to take what he had developed with the name Webcheck to a new level. We would call this Webcheck 2. 
	- A bit like Deep Thought in Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. The first one was pretty good but the second one was going to be bigger, better and have far more features. 
	- That was the plan at any rate but the core principles of the solution never really changed. The number 1 feature was that the monitoring engine, which we called it, would do a job of checking a list of servers and services and tell us if any went out of wack. 
	- This sounds simple but the things that are being monitored are hundreds of different systems and services in a farm of web services that a multitude of customers are relying on. Ther is no one size fits all that we can just point a tool at and say, 'monitor that'.
	- John, like other big minded thinkers before and since, came up with a set of principles for solving the problem and reduced each into a process and solutions that could be used by everyone in the team and based on open source software.
	- I guess the key strength of Webcheck, aside of a centralised database of all service status that could be relied upon to tell us within minutes if there was a problem, was that it had many what we called agents that could be deployed to any server and would report back to the central database but were all based on the same build and configuration that were only different in that some were for say, Solaris, some for Linux, some for Windows and so on. Each agent ran a set of standard and custom checks that were each plugins that could be written in any languages, so long as they could each be run as a command line and return a status code.
	- It was this guiding principle sthat made this solution a success I think as it meant that any devloper, operations person, whoever, that can at least write a simple script that can do some checks, print out a result and return an exit code can write a plugin that can be run by the agent and report back to the central database.
	- We today ofcourse have more monitoring solutions that we can shake a stick at but at the turn of Y2k, there were few and most were proprietary and expensive. Nagios did not exist at that time, only its predecessor, Netsaint. We used this but had already adopted Webcheck as it was there when it was needed and it worked.
	- Most software we have has been created out of need, not want and suits a specific use case, for which there was at some point not anything else there to do the job. This is how Webcheck came about. It was a solution to a problem that was not being solved by anything else at that time.
	- I got a mail From John a few years back, saying the last of the WebCheck servers had been decomissioned. It was in 2017 TODO - check date. I had left the company by 2007 so it had been running for a long time, considering its 'engine' was written by me in 2000. There were lots of moving parts in this solution and I wastnt alone in developing it. There were many people involved in its development and maintenance over the years. I was just the one that wrote the core engine and that likely got re-written by someone else at some point. I dont know. I was just glad to hear it was used for so long.

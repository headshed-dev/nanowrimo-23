	- Monitoring is something I could put into a category of its own but I put it under a heading of security because it is a security concern. Indeed as time has gone on, I have found it has been entirely ignored by some as we have adopted cloud based solutions and some have assumed that it is someone else's problem.
	- Monitoring is a key part of any service. It is the way we know that things are working as they should be. It is also the way we know that things are failing.
	- Both are as important. If you are in the unfortunate situation of serving customers with whom there is a bad relaitionship, that is, for whatever reason, trust is lost and whatever goes wrong, you, the supplier are seen as the first place to point the finger, then monitoring is your friend. It is the way you can prove that you are not at fault. Trying to regain trust is very difficult when it has been lost. But if you are to stand a chance of doing this, good monitoring is essential. What this does is to give you statistics that you can use to show that service has been maintained and can be used to diagnose problems, even if they are not your fault.
	- If you dont have this in place, the customer will be assured of being the ones to tell you that there is a problem. This is not a good place to be.
	- If you do have good monitoring in place, you can be the one to tell the customer that there is a problem. This is the better place to be and it will reduce the stress on your team and downtime for your customer as you will be alerted to issues before they escalate.
	- Monitoring is not just about the service itself. It is also about the infrastructure that supports the service. If you are using cloud based services, you will be relying on the cloud provider to provide the infrastructure. But you will still need to monitor the service. If you are using your own infrastructure, you will need to monitor that too.
	- A common mistake I have seen in the modern age of cloud and agile is for services and software to follow best principles in all aspects of software creation, iteration and deployment but to ignore monitoring. The overwelming mindset is from a development point of view and an over enphasis on testing being something that is done by the development team but somehow no longer needed when the software is deployed.
	- I think that this is a symptom of another trend that I have seen in the last 10 years or so. That is, the move away from the idea of a system administrator. This is a role that has been replaced by the DevOps engineer. This is a role that is more focused on the development side of things and less on the operations side. This is a role that is more focused on the software and less on the infrastructure. This is a role that is more focused on the development team and less on the customer.
	- Flippantly I call this 'DevDev' as it is a role that is more focused on the development team and less on the customer and an idea that we no longer need operational thinking.
	- it is not surprising as automation has meant that increasingly, outdated and expensive processes once done by operational staff are now done by software. This is a good thing. But it does not mean that we no longer need operational thinking. Operations popele that did not adapt to this change have been left behind. But the need for operational thinking has not gone away. It has just changed.

	- Having spent a lot of my working life having used monitoring and at the lack of solutions pre Y2k, wrote them and created a solution with others led by a team of specialist engineers at one of the leading IT service providers at that time, I think I am

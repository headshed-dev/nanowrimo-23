	- Monitoring is something I could put into a category of its own but I put it under a heading of security because it is a security concern. Indeed as time has gone on, I have found it has been entirely ignored by some as we have adopted cloud based solutions and some have assumed that it is someone else's problem.
	- Monitoring is a key part of any service. It is the way we know that things are working as they should be. It is also the way we know that things are failing. 
	- Both are as important. If you are in the unfortunate situation of serving customers with whom there is a bad relaitionship, that is, for whatever reason, trust is lost and whatever goes wrong, you, the supplier are seen as the first place to point the finger, then monitoring is your friend. It is the way you can prove that you are not at fault. Trying to regain trust is very difficult when it has been lost. But if you are to stand a chance of doing this, good monitoring is essential. What this does is to give you statistics that you can use to show that service has been maintained and can be used to diagnose problems, even if they are not your fault. 
	- If you dont have this in place, the customer will be assured of being the ones to tell you that there is a problem. This is not a good place to be.
	- If you do have good monitoring in place, you can be the one to tell the customer that there is a problem. This is the better place to be and it will reduce the stress on your team and downtime for your customer as you will be alerted to issues before they escalate.

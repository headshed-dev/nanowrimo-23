	- whats the worlds most used language
	- this has become so complicated a debate, I prefer to look at actual devices and work out from that, what kinds of software and langauages I know already can easiliy be used on all or most of them, so I asked this of bing
	- what is the ratio of devices to servers in the world ?
		- According to Statista, the number of internet users worldwide in 2023 was about 4.88 billion, and the number of internet-connected devices per person was about 6.58. This means that the total number of internet-connected devices in the world was about 32.14 billion. Assuming that this number represents the total number of devices in the world, we can multiply it by the market share of each operating system to get the number of devices using each operating system. For example, the number of devices using Windows was about 24.21 billion (75.32% of 32.14 billion), and the number of devices using Android was about 23.25 billion (72.38% of 32.14 billion).
		  However, this method does not account for the number of servers in the world, which are also devices that use operating systems. According to IDC, the number of servers shipped worldwide in 2023 was about 12.4 million, and the number of servers installed worldwide in 2023 was about 64.7 million. Assuming that these numbers represent the total number of servers in the world, we can multiply them by the market share of each operating system to get the number of servers using each operating system. For example, the number of servers using Windows was about 46.6 million (72.10% of 64.7 million), and the number of servers using Linux was about 8.8 million (13.60% of 64.7 million).
		  Therefore, using this method, the ratio of devices to servers in the world using each operating system was as follows:
		- | Operating System | Devices | Servers | Ratio |
		  | ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
		  | Windows         | 24.21 billion | 46.6 million | 519.7:1 |
		  | macOS           | 5.48 billion  | 0.5 million  | 10960:1 |
		  | Linux           | 0.74 billion  | 8.8 million  | 84.1:1  |
		  | Chrome OS       | 0.57 billion  | 0 million    | ∞:1     |
		  | Android         | 23.25 billion | 0 million    | ∞:1     |
		  | iOS             | 8.71 billion  | 0 million    | ∞:1     |
		  | Other           | 0.78 billion  | 8.8 million  | 88.6:1  |
	- so, if I'm to take this highly scientific research of mine seriously, I can deduce that windows is pretty popular, being in billions 24, Android is next at 23, iOS at 8.7, macOS at 5.48, linux chrome and other make up to 2
	- by far then, windows is best. I dont like to hear myself say that but by dint of the numbers, windows rules supreme. Interestingly, Android is by far the most used platform for mobile, so logically, if your after reaching as many mobile users as you can, Android is the clear winner but not if you want rich ones. In the US and eleswhere in the first world, rich people or rather those that want to be rich or think that they are, all have iOS devices. Its a thing ok. Get over it. However if you go to the orient, in particular China, its a very, very different story and surprise surprise to the iOS evangelst, Android is everywhere and Apple is not so super cool.
	- Forgetting the geopolitics and social greasy poles, if you can choose a programming language that can be used to write a piece of software that can run on all of these systems, you have a single language that can run on all these systems. You have a universal language that can be used to run anything, anywhere.
	- Surely then, Java would do this.
		- Funny that, but it seems that in the browser at least, you need do do a lot of difficult and unpleasant things for the average user to get Java to run in the browser. Most devices uses browsers, despite ChromeOS being so low in our charts, the browser is still how most humans are consistently able to access the internet

	- on the internet, in videos and in courses, people are taking it often on themselves to learn to program. I schools and educaton here in the UK where I grew up, computing and programming was pretty much an unknown. I watched Open University programs on the tv as a child as it was the one source of technical information I could get and besides this, it was Tomorrows World and that was your lot. 
	- Sadly though, if anything, the technical coverage and inforamtion in general media and in education in particular seemed over the years to decrease in quality, not get better. Programming has never as far as I am aware become a core skill of schooling, being relegated to after school activities and compmputer clubs that were run by volunteers. The marjority of teaching staff in schools were not technical and had no interest in it. As Microsoft moved into schools, the default becoame Microsoft and the BBC Micro and Acorn computers were replaced by Windows PCs. Soon all children were learning was how to use powerpoint, word and excel. It was percieved that this was all that was needed.
	- When I started out wanting to learn program, I had already taught myself by copying from magazines of the day for the ZX Spectrum and ZX81 which were the hardware I had had access to. Others at that time were the Commodore 64, the Amigas, BBC Micro, Acorn Atom. I would have loved to get my hands on all of them but being eternally skint and the cost of hardware in the 80s was prohibitive.
	- It was a really bad time to be alive if you wanted to use tech but we didnt know how bad it was, as we didnt have any tech. 
	- So what to program in was then, well, limited to the platforms you had limited access to, so for me it was Assembler and Basic. Machine code and Assembler were completely baffling to a young kid with just a few magaziines he could afford with his pocket money and the odd book he could get from the library, so I stuck with Basic. 
	- Today we have a slew of languages to choose from, but the problem is, which one to choose and we now suffer from decision paralysis there are so many to choose from.
	- My learning to write in different languages has taught me one thing, that which ever langage you choose, you should be able to achieve pretty much similar results in all of them, unless you've really chosen a bad one. So picking something that is widely used and can run upon multiple platforms is a good to have. Back in the before times, you typically ended up writing in the few languages that the platform you were using supported. The very idea of being able to choose a language that could run on multiple platforms was a far and misty dream. On placement when I went through University I ported code from Data Generals all written in RPG 2 to a language called Cyber Query. The latter was the start of languages that ran on different platforms, in this case on Unix, Solaris and Sun hardware but this would have had other targets too. RPG 2 however was something you would not likely find yourself writing on general purpose PCs or workstations and was very much a language of the mainframe.
	- When I look at the estate of hardware I can write software for and which languages I can write in, I find a big hitter is Javascript. Its not a very nice language to write in. In the Y2K days it was quite plainly horrible. Despite this, I worked with engineers that at the time used it in Netscape server software to wrtie back end code, as well as that which ran in the browser. When Microsoft destroyed Netscapes market place in the browser wars, this approach became long forgotten. 
	- Little did we know that Javascript would become the most used language in the world.
	- Google however happened and one of the things they needed to do was to create technologies that can crawl the web, find content, index it and present it to us, its users to anwers for our searches. 
	- To do this, they would have used headless bots. Im guessing as they didnt like Perl and favoured Python and Java that some of these bots would have been written in these languages and the uptake of Python in particular more or less wiped out Perl as a language of choice for web development. 
	- The browser though was a big problem. Not just because of the browser wars and Microsofts tactics to destroy Netscape, but also they introduced technologies into their browsers that others did not support. Standards compliatn browsers like Netscape and Mozilla were not able to keep up with Microsofts pace of innovation and so the web became a mess of incompatible technologies.
	- As time went on and an increasing reliance upon Javascript in the browser took hold, a traditional web crawler would not be able to crawl the web as it would not be able to execute the Javascript in the browser.
	- So Google went about creating a headless browser that could execute Javascript and crawl the web. This was called Chrome and it was a game changer. We all know what happened next. Google open sourced the technology and it became the basis of the Chromium project.
	- Not only did Chrome become a dominant technology but also, others saw its potentioal and NodeJS was born. NodeJS is a Javascript runtime that can run on the server. This was a game changer. Now you could write code in Javascript that could run on the server and in the browser. Just like you could all those years ago with Netscape Server. History repeats itself.
	- Other projects came out of this, Electron for example, which is a framework for writing desktop applications in Javascript, it uses NodeJS and Chromium to do this. Many applications your using today are written in Electron. Slack is one that surprises most, Discord is another. VSCode, the editor I am using to write this is also using Electron. These are just a few examples but there are more.
	- So now, Javascript is being used to develop applications, not just add annoying pop ups and adverts to your web pages. Those applications are not just in the browser but also on the desktop and on the server.
	- There are few languages that can boast this cross platform coverage. 
	- When your writing in a language and have to change to another one, just in order to write code for a different platform, you not only have to learn a new language. Lets suppose, as for myself, you already know those languages, you still have to switch in your mind from the one and to the other, which is a context switch. This is a cognitive load that you have to bear. Its not a big one but its still there.
	- I used to liken interuptions in my work to being like interupts on the bus of the motherboard. If you have too many interupts, your whole system slows down. The same is true of your brain. If you have too many context switches, your brain slows down its ability to complete the task at hand as it becomes more busy dealing with these 'interupts' and switching context. 
	- When I'm trying to be as productive as I can, I need to choose the least complex path to my goal. If I can write in a language that can run on all the platforms I need to target, I can reduce the number of context switches I need to make and therefore be more productive.
	- So it may well be 'better' to write in languages that others favour and for those that some think are 'cool' but if your interested in getting the job done, sometimes you have to put aside your own personal preferences and go with what works.
	- Companies often think this way, as they should and they are going to hire people that use the technology that is used in their company. If you want to work for them, you need to use the technology they use. If you want to work for yourself, you need to use the technology that is most widely used. So learning a language that interests you but does not fit a need could be a big waste of your time, aside of learning to program.

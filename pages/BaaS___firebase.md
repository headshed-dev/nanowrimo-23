- Firebase Crashlytics can record both crashes and non-fatal exceptions. Crashes are unhandled exceptions that terminate the app, while non-fatal exceptions are handled exceptions that do not cause the app to crash. [You can use FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().recordException(e) to log non-fatal exceptions on Crashlytics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43092383/log-non-fatal-errors-on-crashlytics)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43092383/log-non-fatal-errors-on-crashlytics). [You can also use FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().log(message) to add custom log messages to your crash reports](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports)[2](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports).

	- > Add custom log messages
	  To give yourself more context for the events leading up to a crash, you can add custom Crashlytics logs to your app. Crashlytics associates the logs with your crash data and displays them in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/crashlytics), under the Crashlytics **Logs** tab.

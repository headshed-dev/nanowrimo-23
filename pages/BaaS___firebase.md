- Firebase Crashlytics can record both crashes and non-fatal exceptions. Crashes are unhandled exceptions that terminate the app, while non-fatal exceptions are handled exceptions that do not cause the app to crash. [You can use FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().recordException(e) to log non-fatal exceptions on Crashlytics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43092383/log-non-fatal-errors-on-crashlytics)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43092383/log-non-fatal-errors-on-crashlytics). [You can also use FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().log(message) to add custom log messages to your crash reports](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports)[2](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/customize-crash-reports).

	- Growing up I was familiar with a now pretty much obsolete form of retailer, an ironmonger. I have fond memories of visiting the ironmongers and would wonder at all the things that were in the shop. It seemed that everything I could imagine as ever important was in there. Being a young boy of course, hitting things in with a hammer and nails or sawing a piece of wood for a shelf thing or screwing something into the wall with raw plugs and using a power drill or sanding something to paint it, all the things that i could ever want for or need were in the ironmongers. A veritable cave of delights was set there before me. The person at the shop counter was sometimes a formidable opponent that could make your day a difficlult one if they felt like it, so acted a

	- 1st september 2007 I bookmarked the [twiki security plugin](https://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/SecurityPlugin) which is a method of protecting page content in a 'Twiki' or wiki. Its as I remmember a method of 'access control' that you can use in what would otherwise be a public access Wiki. 
	- Web pages back in the beginning, were, as they are now, protected from being changed by virtue of their file systems being marked as read only by users in general and only writable by the owner of the file. This is a file level attribute in the operating system and this pricinple applies for any OS but in Unix this might be expressed as ```chmod 644``` which means that the file is readable by all but only writable by the owner. The numbers 644 refer to the octal representation of the file permissions and relate to 3 sets of permissions, read, write and execute. The first number is the owner, the second is the group and the third is everyone else.
	- A further level of control is provided by the web server itself which can be configured to allow or deny access to files based on the IP address of the client. Additional to this, the http protocol allows for us to 'GET' web pages as it is a 'stateless' protocol. This means that the server does not know who is asking for the page and so it cannot make a decision about whether to allow or deny access to the page. We can also 'POST' pages to the server and this is how we can change the content of a page. The server can be configured to allow or deny access to the POST method based on the IP address of the client. There are more methods, such as PUT, PATCH and DELETE which are used by RESTful APIs to further mutate data on the server.
	- Deciding on who can change data and how this is managed is quite a thing to get right. When we just had something like a Unix server onto which we shelled into, edited pages and saved them, permissions for the world to read our pages under `/var/www/html` were set to 644 and we were done. 
	- But when the idea of 'on line collaboration' came into being, how could be allow people that we approved of to make changes to our glorious web pages?
	- Wiki pages, whilst being usefull as read only web sites were ok but it would have been impracticle for everyone that needed to contribute to pages of data to access a separate system in order to do so. 
	- So we needed something better and we see the result of this in the most well known implementation of a wiki, Wikipedia. It changed evertyhing in the way that information is created and shared. Some of us are old enough to remember something that Microsft called 'Encarta' which was a CD-ROM based encyclopedia. It was a great idea but it was not a wiki and so it was not a collaborative effort. We also paid hard cash for it unless you were able to get an out dated version from a magazine cover disk, which I often did, rather than, as was the custom for many to get a hooky copy from a friend or a market stall. Software piracy was rampant in the 90s and it was not until the advent of the internet that we were able to get software for free and legally through open source software.

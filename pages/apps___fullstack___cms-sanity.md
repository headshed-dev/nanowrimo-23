	- Content management systems ( CMS ) are a type of software that allows users to create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.
	- Early CMS software was designed to simplify the process of creating and managing websites, and was primarily used by web developers and were often incorporated into the web platforms themselves. WordPress, for example, is a framework for creating web sites and web content but is also a CMS that can be used to create and manage content.
	- I worked with web programmers that started out on HTML, CSS as it became available and then PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript as the ecosystem around building web sites came to be. Some would have written their own CMS, others would have used a CMS that was available at the time but ofcourse, there would have been a time when there was no CMS that was widely available, let alone open source ones. Indeed, to this day, there are many commercial solutions that provide for contnet management and which in some cases, eye wateringly expensive and used by companies perhaps as a status symbol.
	- An intersting comment I remember from one such developer who had written their own CMS and from time to time continued to do so was that with solutions such as Drupal and Wordpress, that he said that he regretted having done so as this was such a time consuming task and that he would have been better off using one of the open source solutions that were available at the time. But that said, I would suggest that the very process of writing a CMS would have been a great learning experience and would have given him a deep understanding of the problem domain. Indeed, I as a developer worked on monitoring and availability software that were arguably available as commercial softwares but which were extremely expensive at the time, so writing our own bespoke soluiton that became successeful and cost effective but later could well have been replaced by open source solutions such as Nagios and Zabbix was not a bad thing, as it gave us something that was needed at the time. So in the case of things like CMS software, wrting your own might have been not so much of a bad thing, if only character building. However now, with a plethora of open source alternavies for CMS and all sorts of things in other domains, it makes sense to use these rather than reinvent the wheel. For learning, it is usefull to create a simple, cut down version for a project but for production, it is best to use something that is tried and tested and which has a community around it. If your still hungering and thirsting to do more, becoming part of a community that develops an existing solution could be a good way to go. But I would reason in my own mind that starting an entirely new 'thing' needs careful consideration and a good reason for doing so.

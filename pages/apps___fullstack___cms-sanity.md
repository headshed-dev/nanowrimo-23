	- Content management systems ( CMS ) are a type of software that allows users to create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.
	- Early CMS software was designed to simplify the process of creating and managing websites, and was primarily used by web developers and were often incorporated into the web platforms themselves. WordPress, for example, is a framework for creating web sites and web content but is also a CMS that can be used to create and manage content.
	- I worked with web programmers that started out on HTML, CSS as it became available and then PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript as the ecosystem around building web sites came to be. Some would have written their own CMS, others would have used a CMS that was available at the time but ofcourse, there would have been a time when there was no CMS that was widely available, let alone open source ones. Indeed, to this day, there are many commercial solutions that provide for contnet management and which in some cases, eye wateringly expensive and used by companies perhaps as a status symbol.
	- An intersting comment I remember from one such developer who had written their own CMS and from time to time continued to do so was that with solutions such as Drupal and Wordpress, that he said that he regretted having done so as this was such a time consuming task and that he would have been better off using one of the open source solutions that were available at the time. But that said, I would suggest that the very process of writing a CMS would have been a great learning experience and would have given him a deep understanding of the problem domain. Indeed, I as a developer worked on monitoring and availability software that were arguably available as commercial softwares but which were extremely expensive at the time, so writing our own bespoke soluiton that became successeful and cost effective but later could well have been replaced by open source solutions such as Nagios and Zabbix was not a bad thing, as it gave us something that was needed at the time. So in the case of things like CMS software, wrting your own might have been not so much of a bad thing, if only character building. However now, with a plethora of open source alternavies for CMS and all sorts of things in other domains, it makes sense to use these rather than reinvent the wheel. For learning, it is usefull to create a simple, cut down version for a project but for production, it is best to use something that is tried and tested and which has a community around it. If your still hungering and thirsting to do more, becoming part of a community that develops an existing solution could be a good way to go. But I would reason in my own mind that starting an entirely new 'thing' needs careful consideration and a good reason for doing so.
	- As it was almost the accepted way that any web framework, often written in PHP, would have had a CMS in built, it was not uncommon to think of CMS as being the web framework itslef. However over the last 10 years or so, this boundary has gradually changed to the point where we now have the term 'headless CMS' where by the contntent management system is entirely separate to the web site technology all together. The two disciplines are thus parted, CMS being a domain of its own. Interoperability between the two is evolved to a number of different integrations, most of which follow a RESTful API approach. Some have also adopted GraphQL as a means of integration. The advantage of this approach is that the CMS can be used to manage content for a number of different web sites and web applications, and indeed, other applications such as mobile apps. The CMS is thus a central repository for content that can be used by a number of different applications. This is a powerful concept and one that is becoming more and more popular.
	- There are open source CMS solutions that can be self hosted and perhaps many more that are offered as web services that are often paid for on some kind of subscription basis. This software as a service approach is popular with companies and organisations that do not want to become involved in the technical aspects of hosting and maintaining the CMS software. The advantage of this approach is that the CMS is maintained by the service provider and the user can concentrate on the content and the web site or application that is consuming the content. The disadvantage is that the user can become tied to the service provider and if the service provider goes out of business or changes the terms of the service, the user is at the mercy of the service provider. Some call this 'tie in' or 'vendor lock in' and others I have come across may go to somewhat extreme measures in order to avoid said lock ins. Perhaps some may go too far and with the risk of re-inventing wheels but that is a topic perhaps for another time.
